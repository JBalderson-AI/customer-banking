## Module 3 Challenge: Create a customer banking system
## Description
This challenge project includes an interactive banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

## Usage
This is only a test project, and is not a complete working system. 

## Contributing
If you would like to add more to this so that it is a fully functional system - please do! Free to all, for any purpose.
